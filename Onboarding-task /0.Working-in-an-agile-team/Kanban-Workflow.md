# üîç Research & Learn
1. How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
    A Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that helps teams track tasks and manage their progress. It uses a board with columns representing different stages of a workflow, and cards (often sticky notes) to represent individual tasks that move across the board as work progresses. This visualization, along with WIP (work in progress) limits, helps teams identify bottlenecks, improve efficiency, and ensure a smooth flow of work. 
2. What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
    Kanban board columns represent different stages of a workflow. Common columns include Backlog (unstarted tasks), In Progress (tasks currently being worked on), Blocked (tasks with impediments), and Done (completed tasks). These columns visualize the flow of work, and their specific names and quantities can be customized to fit a team's unique process. 
3. How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
    Tasks move through a board by being physically or virtually transferred between columns representing different stages of a workflow. Typically, the team member actively working on a task is responsible for updating its status on the board, reflecting its progress as it moves from one stage to the next. This ensures the board accurately reflects the current state of all tasks and helps maintain transparency and workflow efficiency. 
4. What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
    Limiting Work In Progress (WIP) offers several benefits, including increased focus, faster lead times, improved quality, and reduced waste. By limiting the number of tasks a team is actively working on, WIP limits help reduce context switching, improve team collaboration, and make bottlenecks more visible. This leads to a more efficient and productive workflow, resulting in faster delivery of value to customers. 
# üìù Reflection
1. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
    The visualisation of work distribution and putting definite boudaries to the amounts of work that one can do at a time, as defined by Kanban, allow priotizing and preventing overloads. It is obvious what is going on, what is pending, and where the bottlenecks can emerge (there are such as To Do, In Progress, and Done). Work In Progress (WIP) limits are also very effective because they will prevent team members who get too many tasks ar a time which often leads to high work context switching and burnout. This makes the team concentrated and also leads to effective task accomplishment instead of doing too many things.
2. How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
    I can split larger tasks into smaller, manageable cards and a sheet to trace them on the board (such as Trello, Jira, or GitHub Projects) which would help me to improve the application of the Kanban principle to work. I will only have 1 or 2 tasks in the status of being progress, so that I do not overwhelmed and ill. Seeing the board frequently during stand-ups or end of line check-in, allows me to keep my eyes on changing priorities and make more realistic and accurate estimates of what I can get done within a specific period of time.
# üõ†Ô∏è Task
1. Check out Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)
    The task have been structured in several column based on the priorities of the task.
2. Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.
    Not yet.
3. Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
    In order to better track the tasks, it would be benefical to add e.g. clear acceptance criteria or how to track in checklist items in each card. This is helpful to make the tasks completed and imparially- this is partically helpful when used in design or development steps in whcih Done may have various definitions by various individuals. Adding such remarks as "Component visually matches Figma," or "Accessibility tested" or "Written tests in place" would make it clearer and more consistent to comeTo improve task tracking, adding clear acceptance criteria or checklist items directly in each card would help. This ensures tasks are done thoroughly and objectively‚Äîespecially useful for design or development steps where ‚ÄúDone‚Äù can mean different things to different people. Including criteria like ‚ÄúComponent visually matches Figma,‚Äù ‚ÄúAccessibility tested,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWritten tests in place‚Äù would make it clearer and more consistent to complete these requirements.
