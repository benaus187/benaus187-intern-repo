# üîç Research & Learn
1. What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?
    - Developers
    Responsible for designing, coding, and delivering the product features. They participate in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. Developers collaborate closely with other roles to turn user stories into working software and continuously improve code quality.
    - QA (Quality Assurance)
    Ensures that the product meets quality standards before release. QA team members write and run test cases, report bugs, and work with developers to resolve issues. In Agile, QA is integrated into the development cycle (not just at the end), often using test automation and continuous testing practices.
    - Product Manager (PM)
    Owns the product vision and ensures that the team is building the right features. The PM manages the product backlog, writes user stories, prioritizes work based on business value, and serves as the bridge between users, stakeholders, and the dev team. Their focus is on what gets built and why.
    - Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)
    Facilitates Agile ceremonies (like stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives), removes blockers, and helps the team stay on track. The Agile PM supports team collaboration and promotes continuous improvement, but does not micromanage. Their goal is to create a smooth, efficient process and protect the team‚Äôs focus.
    - Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)
    UX/UI Designers: Create user flows, wireframes, and visual designs to ensure the product is usable and accessible.
    Stakeholders: Include business leaders or clients who define strategic goals and provide feedback during sprint reviews.
    Customer Support: Provides insights into real user issues and helps identify feature or bug priorities based on user reports.
2. How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
    In Scrum, roles are clearly defined with the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, each having specific responsibilities. Collaboration happens within the framework of sprints, with regular meetings to plan, review, and improve. Kanban, on the other hand, doesn't prescribe specific roles but emphasizes team collaboration and visualizing the workflow. Team members in Kanban collaborate to manage the workflow, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve the process. 

# üìù Reflection
1. What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
As a front-end developer intern, my role boundaries and functions are bound to merge with those of many other people in the Agile team:
    - With the Product Manager (PM): I use the PM to make user stories definitions and priories clear. When creating UI Elements related to user objectives, I can request a clarification of the requirements on how to be accepted or how to be accepted or how to behave.
    - With QA: I work with QA, to learn about testing needs, so that we build components that could be tested by QA, and to resolve bug reports or usability matters. Effective communication also assists us to deliver quality features.
    - With UI/UX designers: I will turn their wireframes and mockups into the practical, reachable components. I can request design tokens, behavior explanations or even feedback when something cannot be practically done.
    - With the Agile PM or Scrum Master: I will attend daily stand-ups, planning, and restropectives where I raise blockers or ask some help. The Agile PM keeps me on a track of sprint-goal achivement and assists in resolving the problems on the path of work.
    - With Other Developers: I collaborate with backend or full-stack developers to integrate the UI with APIs, check the code of each other, and ensure all elements of the app are styled and structured in a consistency manner. 
2. How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

# üõ†Ô∏è Task
1. Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
    My role in the Agile team is as a developer and therefore my duty is to convert the user stories and design ideas into working good code. I take part in the sprint planning and offer daily updates in standups and in collaboration with designers, QA, and other developers ensuring the features are contructed effectively, and address the needs of users. My job responsilities are front-end code writing in a maintainale style, API intergrations, bug fixes, and product improvement on a regular basis, depending on the feedback.
2. Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
    I often work with UX/UI designers to make interfaces work. In order to enhance my collaboraiton with them, I can offer first-hand technical response at the design stage, explain the interconnection between the design and its constraints or plausibility, make sure that I am asking approriate questions regarding the accessibility and responsiveness. Establishing frequent check-ins and agreeing on common working tools such as FIgma or Storybook, we could eliminate issues related to miscommunication and develop the interface that would reflect the needs of potential users as well as the existing technical restrictions.
