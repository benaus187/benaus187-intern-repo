# üîç Research & Learn

1. What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
    Agile project management is an iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback throughout the project lifecycle, while traditional project management (often referred to as Waterfall) is a linear, sequential process with a focus on upfront planning and rigid adherence to a predefined plan. Agile prioritizes responding to change and delivering value iteratively, whereas traditional methods prioritize control, stability, and detailed documentation.

2. What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)
    The Agile Manifesto outlines four core values and twelve principles that guide agile development. The four core values are: individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. These values emphasize teamwork, delivering functional software, continuous customer engagement, and adaptability.
3. What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
    Scrum and Kanban are both Agile frameworks, but they differ in their approach to workflow and project management. Scrum is structured around time-boxed iterations called sprints, while Kanban emphasizes continuous workflow and visualizing work in progress. Scrum is suitable for complex projects with frequent changes, while Kanban is ideal for managing ongoing processes and smaller tasks.
4. Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
    Focus Bear likely favors Kanban over Scrum due to its flexibility and continuous flow approach, which better suits their needs as a team dealing with varied and evolving priorities. Kanban's visual workflow management and focus on limiting work in progress (WIP) can help teams like Focus Bear to adapt quickly to changing demands and optimize their workflow for faster, more efficient delivery of value.

## üìù Reflection

1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

    - Biggest benefits of Agile:
    Agile is created towards agility, teamwork, and shortening the value delivery. It contains elements of iterations that mean teams can rapidly respond to feedback and changing priorities to minimize the chances of building the wrong thing. Frequent stand-ups, creation of sprint plans, and retrospectives are used to maintain the alignment, improve constantly,and enhance the unity within the team. Agile helps developers, including me, to know what to prioritize and makes a regular demonstration of progress an option.
    - Biggest challenges of Agile:
    Agile is not a problem, when there is a lot of switch of prioritize over which there is no clarity, rework or waste occurs. Unclear acceptance requirement or user stories may also be a hindrance. Also, when participants in a team are not entirely contributing to Agile ceremonies and not sharing blockers, they might retard progress. The other typical issue that appears during high-velocity in the Agile environment can be stated as the need to strike a balance between speed, code quality, and technical debt.

1. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
    Agile principles assist in enhancing my position as a developer since it offers form without stiffness. Frequent sprint planning and backlog grooming provide me with a set of tasks to prioritize, and this makes me less confused and allows me to remain productive. The stand-ups every day guarantee me that I am on the same page with the rest of the team and can communicate blockers promptly. The focus on iterative development enables me to make small but valuable changes fast and also provides feedback much earlier, which enhances the quality of my work. Agile likewise focuses on constant learning and advancing, which helps me to develop through retrospectives and feedback cycles but also create an environment of cooperation and shared support.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

- Scrum follows sprints of definite length (normally 1-2 weeks) during which the team plans, implements, and revamps a group tasks. It has ceremonies - the planned happenings - like stand ups, sprint planning and retrospectives. Scrum works best when you need to have a stability of pace and timeboxed objectives.
- Kanban, however, is less rigid and flow based. the work is divided into columns such as To Do, In Progress and Done, and the team does not concentrate on finishing a sprint but aims to have work-in-progress. It is wonderful to plan workload and prevent overloading.

1. Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
    Do it in short iterations (a few weeks to a few months), with a bias to shorter in delivering working software. This philosophy helps me be focused on developing small, functional features that can be reviewed and enhanced in a short period. It stimulates advancement, rapid feedback and the feeling of accomplishment.
