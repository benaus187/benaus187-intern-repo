# üîç Research & Learn

1. What is a "User Manual for Me", and why do teams use them?
   A "User Manual for Me" is a document outlining an individual's work style, communication preferences, and key aspects of their professional persona, designed to help colleagues understand how best to interact and collaborate with them. Teams use them to improve communication, build empathy, and foster a more productive and understanding work environment.
2. What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)
   Helpful categories to include when describing communication style, work habits, and feedback preferences include: communication styles, work approach, feedback preferences, preferred communication channels, level of autonomy, and decision-making style.
3. How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstanding?
   Running the My User Manual Play creates a dedicated safe space for teams to reduce misunderstanding by clarifying expectations and sharing how best to collaborate with a specific co-worker. Research shows that making work process preferences explicit benefits collaboration.

## üìù Reflection

1. What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)
   I appreciate clear expectation, direct but polite communication and a collaborative nature in order to perform at my peak. My ideal team players are responsive, flexible ro give ideas, and tolerant to diverse working styles. There should also be flexibility, at least in case priorities change and there should be little unwarranted interruptions on focus time.
2. How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)
   To the majority of updates and discussions, I would recommend using asynchronous tools such as Email because I would have time to process them and reply intelligently. But in case the subject matter is more complicated or when I should keep a pace, I like a quick video call or check-ins to provide closure and proceed.
3. What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)
   I will remain focused through a quiet and clutter-free working environment and by means of using well-structured to do managerial lists that divide the tasks into easily manageable parts. To be able to stay in the zone, I find that deep work sessions are helpful; it is time usually between 60 to 90 minutes of uninterrupted time. Sometimes with instrumental music or ambient sound, I enhance concentration.
4. How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)
   I like honest, straightforward and positive feedback with certain examples and suggestions on how to improve myself. Positive reinforcement encourages me to motivate. I prefer both, written and verbal feedback, although it depends on the situation in different cases : a written response is the best used in real-time discussions.
5. What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)
   This is because in group discussions or during brainstorming I always require a little time to digest. I like writtent instructions because I find it easiest to understand and reference instructions and I would like to brainstorm where the idea is not final yet and one is trying to perfect the ideas with others. I like to follow the details and then proofread my work, so I may check some questions before we begin to work.
