1. What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)
    In a casual work environment, professional behavior demonstrates respect for colleagues and the workplace, while unprofessional behavior can disrupt teamwork and create a negative atmosphere. Professionalism includes clear communication, punctuality, active listening, and taking responsibility. Unprofessionalism manifests as gossip, lack of punctuality, poor communication, and disrespect. 
2. What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)
    Respectful communication in remote teams involves using a positive and inclusive tone in all interactions, actively listening to and validating others' perspectives, and providing constructive feedback in a supportive manner. It also means being mindful of cultural differences, using clear and concise language, and fostering an environment where all team members feel comfortable expressing their opinions. 
3. How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)
    To give and receive feedback professionally, focus on specific actions rather than personality traits, assume positive intentions, and prioritize clear communication through active listening and asking clarifying questions. Avoid defensiveness and instead, approach feedback as an opportunity for growth.

# üìù Reflection
1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
    I have witnessed great teamwork on my university. I think the key thing which made up their teamwork's quality is commmunication. Most of their members are willing to share idea and help each other to improve. 
2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
    I will avoid jargon and speak directly and respectfully without using any jargon and discourse in order to facilitate clear, respecful and inclusive communication, active listening and checking understanding. I will also remember not to interrupt by being conscious of the existing communication styles. I will also adopt an inclusive language that does not discriminate against other background against other background or abilities and ensure that everyone can contribute, particularly, in the groups.
3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
    To develop a positive environment, I can express appreciation to efforts of other people, be friendly and open, and promote collaboration/ I slck at no time, handle the dealines, and demonstrate professionalism in my conduct, which trusts me. A bit of light-heartedness at the right place works fine to make the space at least more enjoyable but keeping it focused on the work targets at the same time, may it be celebrating small victories. 
4. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
    My preparation will include taking a look at the meeting agenda, compiling the necessary documents or questions, and evaluating the attempys or barries that I should report on. I will be prompt, will gave noires or news, and will remain attentive during the meeting. Being prepared does not only respects the time of others but also makes the meeting productive.
5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
    Being proactive implies taking initiatives- clarifying and early, volunteer to assist team members or to look into a task instead of questioning. It consists in being well-organized, being proactive in predicting needs, and finding options to create value even in non-assigned areas. The responsible intern will share the lasted news and accept feedback to develop.  
6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
    In case I do require an answer, a polite pursuit after an appropriate period, e.g., 12 days, through an agreed-upon channel of communication (e.g., Slack or email), will be the first thing to do. At the point where I am yet to get a response, I would resort to a direct message or may check in at a team meeting. In case any delay has affected deadlines or project progress, then I would come out and take it to the next level by informing my team lead or supervisor directorially and to the best of my knowledge and ability, giev them the details and the conseuqences of such delay of demand, preferably only after 3-5 days of delay yet undecided.
7. What are some things you won't do?
    I will not neglect dealines and fail to respond to the communication of the team. I will not jump into conclusions, speak disparagingly, or claim other people work. I will also disclose privileged information and fail to follow up on documentation and allow blockers to reside. In the first place, I will not violate the level of professionalism and trust that I bear as an intern.
