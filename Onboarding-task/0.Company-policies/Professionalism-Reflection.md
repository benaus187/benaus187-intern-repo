1. What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behavior in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)
    In a casual work environment, professional behavior demonstrates respect for colleagues and the workplace, while unprofessional behavior can disrupt teamwork and create a negative atmosphere. Professionalism includes clear communication, punctuality, active listening, and taking responsibility. Unprofessionalism manifests as gossip, lack of punctuality, poor communication, and disrespect.
2. What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)
    Respectful communication in remote teams involves using a positive and inclusive tone in all interactions, actively listening to and validating others' perspectives, and providing constructive feedback in a supportive manner. It also means being mindful of cultural differences, using clear and concise language, and fostering an environment where all team members feel comfortable expressing their opinions.
3. How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)
    To give and receive feedback professionally, focus on specific actions rather than personality traits, assume positive intentions, and prioritize clear communication through active listening and asking clarifying questions. Avoid defensiveness and instead, approach feedback as an opportunity for growth.

## üìù Reflection

1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
   In one of my university's subject, we developed a web app for managing book rentals. i was responsible for the frontend react component.
    - What made our teamwork effective was clear communication and defined roles.
    - Every week, we held short stand-up meetings where each member shared progress and blockers.
    - when a teammate got stuck on API integration, others jumped in to help.
    - Because of this collaboration, we finished the project on time and got great results.
    I plan to apply this same approach at Focus Bear- actively communicating progress and helping teammates whenever possible.
2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
    - Avoid jargon and slang in written messages; write short, clear updates.
    - Use inclusive like "we" instead of "you should.."
    - LIsten actively in meetings and confirm understanding with phrase like, "JUst to clarify..".
    - Respond politely and on time in Slack to maintain trust.
3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
    - Focus on actions, not personality. For example: "Consider renaming this function for clarity" instead of "Your code is confusing".
    - Assume good intent and ask for clarification before reacting defensively.
    - Personal Example: During a mobile app assignment, a teammate told me my UI design was "hard to navigate". I ask for examples, received suggestions, and updated my layout. The feedback improved our final grade and taught me to treat feedback as a learning opportunity.
4. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
    - Read the agenda and gather all needed documents or code updates beforehand,
    - Write down questions or blockers to discuss.
    - Be ready to give concise progress updates to respect everyone's time.
    - I will follow this at Focus Bear so my check-ins are always productive.
5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
    - Volunteering to handle small bugs or documentation without waiting to be assigned.
    - Communicating early if i see potential delays.
    - Suggesting improvements (like a more effective workflow) instead of waiting to be asked.
    - For example, if I notice repetitive manual tasks in React components, I'll propose refactoring them into reuseable components.
6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
    - Follow up after 1-2 bussiness days with a polite reminder via email or Discord.
    - If no response and it's blocking my work, escalate after 3-5 days to my lead or supervisor.
    - I will apply this at Focus Bear to keep tasks moving without waiting too long or overwhelming teammates.
7. What are some things you won't do?
    - I will not miss deadlines without communication.
    - I will not gossip, ignore messages, or dismiss others' contributions.
    - I will never share private company information or bypass team processes.
    - I will not let blockers linger silently; i will escalate responsibly.
