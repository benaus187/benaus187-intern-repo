### 🛠️ Task

1. Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.
   I will use encrypted, secure cloud storage (e.g., OneDrive with two-factor authentication) to store and manage all sensitive project data, instead of keeping files locally or in unprotected folders.
   This ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access, especially in the event of device loss or theft, and aligns with privacy policies like those outlined by Focus Bear.
2. Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.
