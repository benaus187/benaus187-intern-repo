# Company Reflection

1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
    Focus Bear was designed to assist neurodivergent people, in particular, ADHD others or individuals with Autism, get focused, develop beneficial tendencies, and minimize distractions in a systematic and considerate manner. Its functions such as habit routines, focus modes, and blocking websites demonstrate the keen knowledge of the challenges that these users face because of the lack of executive functions and productivity.
2. What problem is Focus Bear solving?
    Focus Bear is resolving the issue of overwhelm and distraction in contemporary digital settings. Task initiation, time blindness and attention management is a problem to many people and more so those with ADHD. However, classic productivity apps are either too stiff or one-dimensional, whereas Focus Bear customizes its practice by initiating action through behavior nudges, achievement tour guides, and the encouragement of deep work so that users can do what is most essential to them.
3. Why do you think this mission is important?
    The importance of this mission lies in the fact that digital overload and attention dysregulation are some of the most common problems, and people struggle while using the existing tools most of the time because of their individual neurological needs. Focus Bear is filling a gap that many neurodivergent users have experienced with productivity technology by focusing on neurodivergent users to give them a functional and empathetic tool.
4. how does Focus Bear's work align with your personal values or interests?
    Focus Bear is also an inclusive design tool, which as a developer and someone with an interest in inclusive design and mental health, I have a lot of interest in the mission of the company. I also like how the product does not only manage to block distractions, but also constructs positive daily structure - which, I think, should be a philosophy of both self-improvement and software design.
5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
    Yes. I have also had to encounter those moments in which maintaining focus and adhering to routines might not come easy particularly when one is doing work at home or handling several activities at once. The organization of the Focus Bear challenge to break down and daily routine as well as gentle, but persistent encouragement system seems like a system that I would happen to find a successful one myself, at least during the busy course or project time of year.

## We want you to think about this personally not just get AI to write a vague answer. Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?

    I do not know lots of people at university but in case I had to choose anybody, then I would choose myself. I never possess the ability to tackle one subject at a time without getting easily distracted and this is particularly true when I am preparing written exams- which I had not actually done in years. Although I studied as long as I could day and night, it did not seem too good and I got overwhelmed.  
    Since I have found Focus Bear, it became clear to me that productivity does not consist in making yourself study more. It is all about making good habits, taking properly organized breaks, and interfering with distraction smarter. The app has made me see that it is not only hard work but also necessary to have the proper environment as well as habits. In my opinion, the focus bear would actually save people like myself with or without the diagnosis whom have lacked some focus and the support of slowing down without being drained out by the method of moving at a snail pace.
