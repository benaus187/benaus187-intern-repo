# Learning Goals

1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?
    - I hope to gain real-world experience working in a professional software development team and learn how to collaborate effectively in an Agile environment.
    - Specifically, I want to improve my skills in React and TypeScript for frontend development, and gain a better understanding of how to work with REST APIs and Git for version control in an actual project.
2. What skills are you most excited to develop?
    - Technical Skills: Strengthening my React/TypeScript coding ability and learning better state management techniques like using useState and useEffect effectively.
    - Teamwork & Communication: Practicing how to collaborate on GitHub, review pull requests, and handle merge conflicts in a team environment.
3. Share a teamwork experience from university (what worked or didn’t):
    - I worked on a university group project building a small web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - What worked: We divided tasks clearly, and I handled the frontend interface.
    - What didn’t: We didn’t use Git properly, which caused overwriting each other’s files and made last-minute integration stressful.
    - I want to apply what I learn here to avoid those mistakes by using proper branching, pull requests, and code reviews.
4. What do you think you can contribute to the team?
    I can contribute by:
    - Supporting frontend development and quickly implementing features in React.
    - Testing and debugging the UI to ensure a smooth user experience.
    - Bringing a positive attitude and willingness to learn, which helps the team move faster.
5. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
    - I feel less confident in handling complex React components and resolving Git conflicts.
    - During my previous university projects, I often struggled with merging changes and maintaining clean commits.
    - I want to improve my confidence in collaborative coding so I can work smoothly with other developers.
6. What is one personal goal or project you’d like to contribute to here?
    I would like to implement a small feature in the Focus Bear app, such as improving a UI component or creating a new onboarding screen, and have it successfully reviewed and merged by the team.
7. How will you measure your success in this internship?
    - Completing at least 2–3 features or bug fixes that are merged into the main branch.
    - Presenting my work in a sprint review or demo to the team.
    - Becoming confident in using React and Git without fear of merge conflicts or breaking the build.
