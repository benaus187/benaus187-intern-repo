# Git knowledge 
1. Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
    Yes, I have used Git before while collaborating on coding with my friend at University and personal coding exercises.
2. Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
    I chose VS code because it intergrates directly with Git and GitHub, making commits and pull requests easier. I'm also familiar with it for a while so it will be the best option.
3. What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
    I learned how branchese and pull requests help keep the main branch stable while working on new features. Before i only know how to push and pull from the main only but it will be different after today learning more about Git.
