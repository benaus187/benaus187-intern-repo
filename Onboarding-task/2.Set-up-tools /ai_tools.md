# AI tools
1. Which AI tools did you try?
    GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT
2. What worked well? What didn't?
    Worked Well
    - GitHub Copilot was showing rapid, contextual recommendations when I typed. It assisted in saving time in which one had to write similar code and boilerplate functions. It was more useful in the JavaScript and Python.
    - ChatGPT was awesome in debugging. I copied my error messages, and I obtained breakdowns of what could be wrong in details. It also made strange concepts understandable (e.g. closures in JavaScript or async/await).
    Didn't worked well
    - Copilot also made wrong or redundant suggestions in some cases, mostly when working on more complicated tasks or ones that Copilot had not yet learned.
    - I had trouble getting the AI tools to go beyond my project brief unless my instructions were very detailed.
3. When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
    - Saving the typing for boilerplate code.
    - Tackling syntax or logic issues and getting past them.
    - Acquire and practice as much new programming rules as I can.
    - Figuring out foreign lib's or API's
