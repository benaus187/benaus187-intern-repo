2. Reflection 
    - The best shortcuts:  
        The most time-saving ones are multi cursor (cmd + D, option + cmd + ↑/↓) and fast file navigation (cmd + P). 
        I get to refactor and move freely without the use of the mouse. 
    - How shortcuts improve productivity: 
        - Less mousing around and context switching. 
        - Allows a quicker way of navigating code, editing and debugging. 
        - The exercise creates muscle memory to be efficient in coding.
