2. Reflection
   - The best shortcuts:  
      The most time-saving ones are multi cursor (cmd + D, option + cmd + ↑/↓) and fast file navigation (cmd + P). They allow me to edit multiple parts of the file quickly and navigate without leaving the keyboard
   - Real-Life example :
     While editting my git_understand.md file, I noticed I used the phrase commit message multiple times. By pressing cmd+D, i could select and edit all occurrences at once.
