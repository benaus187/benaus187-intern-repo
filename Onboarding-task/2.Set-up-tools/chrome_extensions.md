# Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions
1. Which extensions did you install? Why?
    1. React Developer Tools
    - Reason:To inspect React component hierarchy, props, and state in the browser.
    - Most Useful: Helped debug components in the Focus Bear app during development and verify state changes.
    2. Redux DevTools
    - Reason: To visualize Redux state changes and actions in real-time.
    - Most Useful: Allowed me to track dispatched actions and confirm that my reducers updated the state correctly during UI testing.
    3. Lighthouse
    - Reason: To audit website performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.
    - Most Useful: I ran Lighthouse audits on Focus Bearâ€™s onboarding pages to identify performance improvements and accessibility issues.

2. What was the most useful thing you learned?
    The React Developer Tools extension is the most helpful because it shows a clear tree of components, props, and state changes.  
    - Example: While testing a PR for the onboarding UI, I used React DevTools to confirm that button clicks updated the state and triggered the correct re-renders.
